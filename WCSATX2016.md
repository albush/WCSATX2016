> That seems like a lot.
-- me

^ When I listed them all, I was shocked. That's a lot of content. And I'm not even what I would consider a prolific content creator. I had a great discussion with a colleague, and through our discussion I realized that The Rules of Improv have shaped the way I approach content creation.

> The hardest thing about writing is writing.
-- Nora Ephron

![](hardestpart.jpg)

^ Writing can be hard. It can be taxing, it can be frustrating. Writing is hard, because we say "No."

---

# [fit] No.

^ We say "No" to our ideas.
We say "No" to our voice as a writer.
We say "No" to our writing environment.
We say "No" because we're scared; we say "No" because we've been told that we're not good enough - and we're starting to believe it. We say "No" when we don't have a good idea of what to write.
"No" is the voice of imposter syndrome.
Whatever the reason, we say "No," but Improv teaches us to say "Yes."

---

# [fit] Yes

^ Improv is about saying "yes." Yes to your idea, to your voice as a writer. "yes" to your environment, and "Yes!" to the voice in your head that's reminding you that you're actually pretty great.

## [fit] What is improv?

> Fall, and then figure out what to do on the way down.
-- Del Close

^ Improv is about trust. Trust in yourself. Improv is about removing all obstacles, and trusting yourself to create something great. That's why improv has shaped the way that I create.

# [fit] A ridiculously short[^1] history of improv

[^1]: I'm only exploring improv in the western world, and I've completely left off Keith Johnstone, Jill Bernard, The Groundlings, UCB, or Trish Berrong - among others - but I'm up against a time limit here.

^ Alright, let's talk improv history.

<!-- ---

![fit right](commedia.jpg)

# Commedia dell'arte

* 16th Century Italy
* Sketches loosely improvised
* Stock characters
* Masks and Bits

^ Let's start in Italy, in the 1500s, with the Commedia dell'arte. The Commedia wasn't the first improv, but it's a good place to start. The commedia sketches were loosely improvised and based on established stock characters and scenarios. They relied heavily on stereotypes, identified by masks, and used practiced bits - Lazzi. But their stock characters still live on today. -->

---

![fit left](violaspolin.jpeg)

# Viola Spolin (1906-1994)

* Theatre games for children
* "Everyone can act. Everyone can improvise.”
* *Improvisation for the Theater*
* Mother of Paul Sills

^ Fast forward 4 centuries, to Viola Spolin. She primarily worked with Children, and believed that anyone could be an actor, because we're all capabale of improvising. Her most important work is "Improvisation for the Theatre," a collection of games meant to work on specific elements of the acting process. She's also the mother of Paul Sills.

---

![fit right](paulsills.jpg)

# Paul Sills (1927-2008)

* Compass Players (With David Shepherd)
* Launched an entire generation of comedic actors
* Co-Founded Second City
* Story Theater

^ Paul Sills was a student at the University of Chicago, and he asked his mother to come to Chicago to teach improv to his acting friends at the University. She did. It went well. He went on to create "The Compass Players" with David Shepherd,, which launched the careers of a ton of actors. Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara; Elaine May and Mike Nichols; Alan Alda; Ed Asner; Shelley Berman - basically all of the people that made us laugh in the 60s and early 70s. And then, because that wasn't enough, he founded the Second City.

---

![fit left](Del_Close.jpg)

# Del Close (1934-1999)

* Performer and Director
* Second City
* ImprovOlympic
* *Truth in Comedy*

^ Del Close got his start in the Compass Players, and at Second City. He had a pretty prodigious drug habit, and ended up getting kicked out of Second City. Eventually he moved back to Chicago, and to Second City, where he worked with pretty much everyone who became the first cast of Saturday Night Live. He also directed and taught at ImprovOlympic, and developed a lasting professional partnership with Charna Halpern.

---

![fit right](Charna-Halpern.jpg)

# Charna Halpern (1952- )

* *Truth in Comedy*
* ImprovOlympic
* The Harold

^ Charna and Del co-wrote "Truth in Comedy," a great, fast read, about Improv. She taught The Harold, a popular long-form improv format.
Throughout the years, Charna, Del, Paul, Viola, The commedia performers all taught one rule: "Yes, &"

---

# [fit] Yes,
# [fit] &

^ One of the primary tenants of improv is the concept of “Yes And.” For almost all improvisors, this is the first, and possibly only, rule you learn. Why is yes & so important in improv and in content creation? Because Yes & provides momentum and acceleration. Saying yes keeps the scene going; adding the & adds fuel to the scene. When we teach improv, we really hammer home the message of "Yes." When we write, or more importantly give ourselves excuses not to write - we need to remember to just say yes. Saying yes gets us started. Saying yes is self-impowering. Yes is an affirmation to your voice and to yourself. Saying yes stops that imposter syndrome in its tracks.
^ As you can tell by the comma, this rule has two parts.

---
![fit](sayyes.jpg)

# [fit] Improv Rule 1A: Say "Yes"


^ So why does Rule 1A require that we say "Yes?" Because we're not really good at it.
In theatre, we're conditioned to look for conflict. We call that "drama." Inexperienced improvisors do this. Part of training is to break them of that habit. Improv helps you Break yourself of the habit of saying "no" to yourself.
^ The great thing about "Yes" is that you can't be "wrong." It's improv, you're making it up. Saying "yes" allows you to feel safe with yourself to really go out on a limb and get weird.
If nothing else, agree with yourself and your partner, and you'll have a decent scene. If my scene partner says "Hey Bob, I saw a dinosaur on the bus today," I should agree with her. If I say "no you didn't, you took an Uber to work today," I kill the momentum, and any trust we might have had. That's why we say "yes."

---

![fit](centaurs.jpg)

# [fit] Improv Rule 1B: Add Something

^ But it's not enough to just agree; we have to add something to the scene. That's the "and" part of the rule. You can add anything you want - remember, there are no wrong answers. Ideally, what you add gives your scene partner enough to provide her own "yes, and," and keep the scene moving. That's it.
Let's go back to my previous example of my fictional scene partner's offer "Hey Bob, I saw a dinosaur on the bus today," I need to respond in agreement, but also add something to further along the conversation. "Yeah, Lucy, I know who you're talking about - Jerry. He works in our building. Tried to add me on Linkedin." Now we have a scene.


---

# [fit] Now you're improvising

^ And that's how you improvise.

---

# [fit] The End

^ That's it.

---

![](morerules.jpg)

# [fit] More ~~Rules~~ Tips

^ Just kidding, there are more rules. We should really consider these guidelines, or guardrails, not rules, but "rules" has a certain authority to it.

---

<!-- ![](givegifts.jpg)

# Give Gifts

^ Give Gifts: Don't do bits. Don't make demands. Don't be selfish. Give a gift. Back to that scene about the dinosaur on the bus: If I responded "geez Lucy, you need to stop drinking on the way to work," I might get cheap laugh, but I'm not giving my scene partner much to work with. I've just crushed her idea, and I've wrecked our trust. -->

![fit](lexhat.jpg)

# [fit] Be specific  

^ Specificity is a specific form of gift giving. Specificity is a gift that keeps on giving. If I tell "Lucy" that the dinosaur works in our building, I've agreed. But if I say "That's Jerry. He's the Triceratops in Accounting. It's so like you not to notice him before," I've provided several gifts. Our Dino is a male Triceratops, who has a job at the same company, and Lucy isn't very observant.

---

![fit](dance.jpg)

# [fit] What's special about today?

^ What's Special about today? In improv, like theatre, film, and television, we make create the scene any time and place we want. Why would we choose to make up a scene in the middle of a boring day?
Why did Lucy see Dinosaur today? Maybe she follows up with "You're right, that is just like me. Today's the day I stop ignoring my coworkers and start making friends; Let's go have lunch with Jerry." Now we have more gifts (Lucy ignores her coworkers) and a reason for why today is important - Lucy has decided that she's going to start making friends with her coworkers. What's going to happen? Will she

---

![](shout.jpg)

# [fit] If this is true, what else is true?

^ This is one of my favorites. I think this is a Great exercise to expand beyond a basic idea.
So Jerry is a Triceratops and an accountant? What else can we extract from that?
Jerry is a vegetarian. He's got horns.
Jerry is probably good at math. Jerry has an education. Jerry might be pretty boring.
What else do we know? Jerry rides the bus - is he eco-friendly? Or does he live in a city with viable public transportation? Each of these are specific gifts, that "Yes, and" the conversation.

---

# [fit] Callbacks

![original](callback.jpg)

^ Call backs are a great way to keep an audience involved. A callback is when you refer to something that happened before. The TV Show "Family Guy" is basically one long callback. Arrested Development also did it, but with a much more deft touch. Why are callbacks funny? Because the audience gets to be in on the joke with the performers. Back to our running example, I might be in another scene later on, as a completely different character, and make an off-hand remark about the number of dinosaurs that work in the building across the street. The audience understands the reference, makes the connection on their own, and gets to enjoy the laugh that much more. Callbacks join the worlds we create when we improvise.

# [fit] Follow The Rules:

# Agreement

* Say "Yes" to writing
* There are no wrong ideas
* Build on your ideas: "Yes, &"
* Have Fun

<!-- ![fit left](alan-ref.jpg)

# [fit] Follow The Rules:

# Give Gifts

* Give a reason to read
* Give a reason to write
* Delight your audience

![fit right](alan-ref.jpg)

# [fit] Follow The Rules:

# Specificity

* More detail, more insight
* Readers appreciate detail
* Summary is for Twitter

^ Specificity: When I review beers, the more specific, the better. Don't say it's hoppy, say "the mosaic hops add a great fruity sweetness up front, and an acidic bitterness to the finish."

---

![fit left](alan-ref.jpg)

# [fit] Follow The Rules:

# What's special about today?

* Don't bury the lede
* If you're not interested in this, is your audience?
* Follow the unique angle

---

![fit right](alan-ref.jpg)

# [fit] Follow The Rules:

# "If this is true, what else is true?"

* Find your angle
* Spin off additional posts
* Increase the amount of content you create

^ This is a great way to find your angle on a story. Everyone else is blogging about the specs of a new mobile phone. Find your own Angle, and share that. You know what's great? Writing a post about the new brewery in town. You know what's better? Writing a post about the brewery, another one about the head brewer, another post about how they worked with the graphic designer to create unique, but on-brand can designs. Follow this exercise to start with one basic idea, and build a larger cache of stories to write down the road. Even if you don't write them now, you've got a great backlog to go back to when writers block strikes.

---

![fit left](alan-ref.jpg)

# [fit] Follow The Rules:

# Callbacks

* Reference your own work
* Link to your past posts
* Link to other people's work
* Go back to old posts and link

<!-- # [fit] Breaking the Rules

![](brownbag.jpg)

^ Sometimes we need to break the rules. Even if we're following all of the rules of improv, we sometimes need that extra something to take our work from ordinary to extraodinary. Following the rules of improv can yield content that is well executed technically. But for me, "technically well executed" isn't good enough. I want to be great.

![fit left](napier.jpg)

# Mick Napier (1962- )

* Performer and Director
* Founded Annoyance Theatre
* "Yes &" is boring; not dyanmic enough
* *Improvise:Scene from the Inside Out*
* TL;DR Do something. How was that? Do it more. A lot more.

^ Another school of improv (Mick Napier, Annoyance Theatre) grew out of an answer to “Yes And,” which Napier believed didn’t provide enough dynamic scenes. If everyone agrees, nothing happens. Napier’s philosophy was all about creating strong characters, first and foremost, and staying true to that character, while placing significantly less emphasis – if not completely throwing out – the traditional “rules” of improv.

---

# [fit] What would your character do?

![](bryanyelling.jpg)

^ If your character wouldn't agree, don't agree.
^ Take a look at what you're writing. Do you agree with it? No? Tell us why. The audience needs that extra spark from you, from your voice, to push it from a good piece to a great piece.

---

# [fit] Do more of that.

![](everyoneyelling.jpg)

^ Whatever your character is, do more of that. Are you the grumpy curmudgeon? Great! Add that saltiness to your story. Are you the eternal optimist? Awesome! Make that shine through.

--- -->

<!-- # Workshop

^ Get a topic from the audience - something they've wanted to write, but were stuck on.

^ * Agreement: Do you want to write this? Let's write this.
^ * Yes &: We can write about $topic. "Yes, and we can talk about this aspect of $topic." "Yes, and when we cover that, we can cover this part of $topic, too."
^ * What's special about today?: Does this have any timely significance? Why would a reader keep reading this?
^ * If this is true, what else is true?: Drill down on a few points; what else can we discover? This can become our thesis.
^ * Find some specifics. Drill down into them.
^ * Character stuff - does your blog persona agree/disagree with this? How do you react to it? Do more of that.

![fit](gotyourback.jpg)

^ One last thing before you go - We have a tradition in ComedySportz. Before we take the stage, all of the players pat each other on the back and say "Got your back." We say that, because, more than anything, improv is about trust. "Got your back" is a reminder of that trust.
^ We have a nice WordPress Community here in San Antonio. Let's be supportive and trusting. Let's remind our friends that we've got their backs.
